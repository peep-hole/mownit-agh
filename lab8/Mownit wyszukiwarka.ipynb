Other plants rely on insects or bees to move pollen. The role of flowers is to produce seeds. After the seeds are fertilized, portions of the flower develop into a fruit, which contains the seeds. Plants use seeds to disperse (spread) the plant across the landscape.\n",

      "Flowers have long been admired and used by humans. Most people think that flowers are beautiful. Many people also love flowers for their fragrances (scents). People enjoy seeing flowers growing in gardens. People also enjoy growing flowers in their backyards, outside their homes. People often wear flowers on their clothes or give flowers as a gift during special occasions, holidays, or rituals, such as the birth of a new baby (or a Christening), at weddings (marriages), at funerals (when a person dies). People often buy flowers from businesses called florists.\n",

      "Flower\n",
      "A flower is a part of a plant. Flowers are also called the bloom or blossom of a plant. It sometimes has a stem - a thin pipe - to support the flower. Flowers have petals. The word \"flower\" is usually used only for the part that produces seeds.\n",
      "In many plants, a flower is its most colourful part. We say the plant 'flowers', 'is flowering' or 'is in flower' when this colourful part begins to grow bigger and open out.\n",
      "There are many different kinds of flowers in different areas in the world. Even in the coldest places, for example the Arctic, flowers can grow during a few months.\n",
      "the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms).\n",
      "For plants.\n",
      "Flowers contains the reproductive organs of a plant. Many flowers are dependent upon the wind to move pollen between flowers of the same species. Other plants rely on insects or bees to move pollen. The role of flowers is to produce seeds. After the seeds are fertilized, portions of the flower develop into a fruit, which contains the seeds. Plants use seeds to disperse (spread) the plant across the landscape.\n",
      "As decoration.\n",
      "Flowers have long been admired and used by humans. Most people think that flowers are beautiful. Many people also love flowers for their fragrances (scents). People enjoy seeing flowers growing in gardens. People also enjoy growing flowers in their backyards, outside their homes. People often wear flowers on their clothes or give flowers as a gift during special occasions, holidays, or rituals, such as the birth of a new baby (or a Christening), at weddings (marriages), at funerals (when a person dies). People often buy flowers from businesses called florists.\n",
      "As a name.\n",
      "Some parents name their children after a flower. A couple of common flower names are: Rose, Lily and Daisy.\n",
      "As food.\n",
      "People also eat some types of flowers. Flower vegetables include broccoli, cauliflower and artichoke. The most expensive spice, saffron, comes from the crocus flower. Other flower spices are cloves and capers. Hops flowers are used to flavor beer. Dandelion flowers are often made into wine.\n",
      "Honey is flower nectar that has been collected and processed by bees. Honey is often named for the type of flower that the bees are using (for example, clover honey). Some people put flowers from nasturtiums, chrysanthemums, or carnations in their food. Flowers can also be made into tea. Dried flowers such as chrysanthemum, rose, jasmine are used to make tea.\n",
      "Special meanings.\n",
      "Some people think that some flowers have special meanings. Lilies make people think of life. Red roses make people think of love, beauty, and passion. Poppies make people think of making people feel better after people have died. In Britain, Australia and Canada, red poppies are worn to remember the soldiers who have died in wars. Daisies make people think of children and innocence.\n",

      "Flower Power\n",
      "\"Flower Power\" was a 1960s catchphrase, used by hippies and other people who were against war and violence. These people used flowers as a symbol of life, of love, and of peace. They wore flowers, made art with flowers and images of them, and gave them away often. Hippies sometimes placed flowers in the rifle barrels of marching soldiers.\n",

Other plants rely on insects or bees to move pollen. The role of flowers is to produce seeds. After the seeds are fertilized, portions of the flower develop into a fruit, which contains the seeds. Plants use seeds to disperse (spread) the plant across the landscape.\n",

People enjoy seeing flowers growing in gardens. People also enjoy growing flowers in their backyards, outside their homes. People often wear flowers on their clothes or give flowers as a gift during special occasions, holidays, or rituals, such as the birth of a new baby (or a Christening), at weddings (marriages), at funerals (when a person dies). People often buy flowers from businesses called florists.\n",

      "Special meanings.\n",
      "Some people think that some flowers have special meanings. Lilies make people think of life. Red roses make people think of love, beauty, and passion.

Plants use seeds to disperse (spread) the plant across the landscape.\n",

People often wear flowers on their clothes or give flowers as a gift during special occasions, holidays, or rituals, such as the birth of a new baby (or a Christening), at weddings (marriages), at funerals (when a person dies). People often buy flowers from businesses called florists.\n",

The genus is most widely known by its scientific name Cyclamen being taken into common usage; other names occasionally confusingly, persian violet (it is not related to the violets), or primrose (neither is it a primrose), is to remember Cyclamen was classified in Primulaceae families by authorities.\n",
      "Cyclamen are native to the Mediterranean region from Spain east to Iran, and also in northeast Africa south to Somalia. They are perennial herbaceous aestivating plants, with a surface or underground tuber (derived from the hypocotyl) 4-12 cm diameter, which produces leaves in late winter, and flowers in the autumn; the leaves die down during the hottest part of the Mediterranean summer drought to conserve water. Each leaf or flower grows on its own stem, which shoots up from the hypocotyl. The variegation is thought by some botanists to be a form of natural disruptive camouflage to reduce grazing damage by animals.\n",
      "The hypocotyl grows leaves and flowers on stems, either one flower or one leaf per stem. The stem for leaves and flowers appears identical except in height. The leaves grow on stems of around 6cm height.\n",

Scientists are still discussing how many species there are. The number of species varies between 100 and 250. The genus was named by Linnaeus after Fr. Georg Joseph Kamel S.J., a Jesuit botanist.\n",
      "They are evergreen shrubs and small trees from 2–20 m tall. The leaves are alternately arranged, simple, thick, serrated, usually glossy, and 3–17 cm long. The flowers are large and conspicuous, 1–12 cm diameter, with (in natural conditions) 5–9 petals; colour varies from white to pink and red, and yellow in a few species. The fruit is a dry capsule subdivided into 1–5 compartments, each containing 1–8 seeds.\n",
      "The genus is generally adapted to acidic soils, and does not grow well on chalk or other calcium-rich soils. Most species also have a high rainfall requirement and will not tolerate drought.\n",

      "Many other camellias are grown as ornamental plants for their flowers; about 3,000 cultivars and hybrids have been selected, many with double flowers, as in the gallery below. \"Camellia japonica\" (often simply called Camellia) is the most prominent species in cultivation, with over 2,000 named cultivars; next are \"C. reticulata\", with over 400 named cultivars, and \"C. sasanqua\", with over 300 named cultivars. Popular hybrids include \"C. × hiemalis\" (\"C. japonica\" × \"C. sasanqua\") and \"C. × williamsii\" (\"C. japonica\" × \"C. salouenensis\"). They are highly valued in Japan and elsewhere for their very early flowering, often among the first flowers to appear in the late winter. Late frosts can damage the flowers.\n",
      "Camellias have a slow growth rate. Typically they will grow about 30 centimetres a year until mature although this varies depending on variety and location.\n",

      "For plants.\n",
      "Flowers contains the reproductive organs of a plant. Many flowers are dependent upon the wind to move pollen between flowers of the same species. Other plants rely on insects or bees to move pollen. The role of flowers is to produce seeds. After the seeds are fertilized, portions of the flower develop into a fruit, which contains the seeds. Plants use seeds to disperse (spread) the plant across the landscape.\n",

      "Flowers have long been admired and used by humans. Most people think that flowers are beautiful. Many people also love flowers for their fragrances (scents). People enjoy seeing flowers growing in gardens. People also enjoy growing flowers in their backyards, outside their homes. People often wear flowers on their clothes or give flowers as a gift during special occasions, holidays, or rituals, such as the birth of a new baby (or a Christening), at weddings (marriages), at funerals (when a person dies).

There are 160 species of \"Gladiolus\" endemic in southern Africa and 76 in tropical Africa. The species vary from very small to the spectacular giant flower spikes in commerce.\n",
      "These attractive, perennial herbs are semihardy in temperate climates. They grow from rounded, symmetrical corms, that are enveloped in several layers of brownish, fibrous tunics.\n",
      "Their stems are generally unbranched, producing 1 to 9 narrow, sword-shaped, longitudinal grooved leaves, enclosed in a sheath. The lowest leaf is shortened to a cataphyll. The leaf blades can be plane or cruciform in cross section.\n",
      "The fragrant flower spikes are large and one-sided, with secund, bisexual flowers, each subtended by 2 leathery, green bracts. The sepals and the petals are almost identical in appearance, and are termed tepals. They are united at their base into a tube-shaped structure. The dorsal tepal is the largest, arching over the three stamens. The outer three tepals are narrower. The perianth is funnel-shaped, with the stamens attached to its base. The style has three filiform, spoon-shaped branches, each expanding towards the apex.\n",
      "The ovary is 3-locular with oblong or globose capsules, containing many, winged brown, longitudinally dehiscent seeds. In their center must be noticeable the specific pellet like structure which is the real seed without the fine coat. In some seeds this structure is wrinkled and with black color. These seeds are unable to germinate.\n",
      "These flowers are variously colored, pink to reddish or light purple with white, contrasting markings, or white to cream or orange to red.\n",
      "The South African species were originally pollinated by long-tongued anthrophorine bees, but some changes in the pollination system have occurred, allowing pollination by sunbirds, noctuid and sphingid moths, long-tongued flies and several others. In the temperate zones of Europe many of the hybrid large flowering sorts of gladiolas can be pollinated by small well-known wasps. Actually, They are not very good pollinators because of the large flowers of the plants and the small size of the wasps. Another insect in this zone which can try some of the nectar of the gladioli is the best-known European Hawk-moth \"Macroglossum stellatarum\" which usually pollinates many famous garden flowers like \"Petunia\", \"Zinnia\", \"Dianthus\" and others.\n",

      "Biennial plant\n",
      "A biennial plant is a flowering plant that takes two years to complete its lifecycle. In the first year the plant grows leaves, stems, and roots (vegetative structures); then it enters a period of dormancy over the colder months. Usually, the stem remains very short and the leaves are low to the ground, forming a rosette. Many biennials require a cold treatment, before they will flower. The next spring/summer the stem of the biennial plant becomes much longer. The plant then flowers, produces fruits and seeds before it finally dies. There are far fewer biennials than either perennials or annuals.\n",
      "Under extreme climatic conditions, a biennial plant may complete its lifecycle in a very short period of time (e.g. 3 or 4 months instead of 2 years). This is quite common in vegetable or flower seedlings that were exposed to cold conditions, before they were planted in the ground. This behaviour leads to many normally biennial plants being treated as annuals in some areas.\n",
      "Flowering can be induced in some biennials by application of the plant hormone \"gibberellin\", but this is rarely done commercially.\n",
      "From a gardener's perspective, a plant's status as annual, biennial, or perennial often varies based on location or purpose. Biennials grown for flowers, fruits, or seeds need to be grown for two years. Biennials that are grown for edible leaves or roots are grown as annuals, e.g. beets, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, celery, parsley, and Swiss chard. If a normally biennial plant is grown in extremely harsh conditions, it is likely to be treated as an annual because it will not survive the winter cold. Conversely, an annual grown under extremely favourable conditions may have highly successful seed propagation, giving it the appearance of being biennial or perennial. Some short-lived perennials may appear to be biennial rather than perennial. True biennials flower only once, while many perennials will flower every year once mature.\n",
      "Examples of biennial plants are parsley, \"Lunaria\", silverbeet, sweet William, colic weed, and carrot. The pansy is a biennial often grown as an annual. Plant breeders have produced annual cultivars of several biennials that will flower the first year from seed, e.g. foxglove, stock, and hollyhock.\n",
      "Biennials may be kept alive longer than two years under environmental conditions that prevent them from flowering. Biennial sugar beet was prevented from flowering by not giving it the cold treatment required for flowering. It was kept alive in a greenhouse for 41 months.\n",

      "Allele\n",
      "An allele ((UK), (US)) (from the Greek \"αλληλος allelos\", meaning \"each other\") is a member of a pair or series of different forms of a gene. When people talk about alleles, most often they mean parts of genes that are actually expressed (as part of the genotype of an individual). Sometimes though, the word is used to refer to sequences that are not expressed.\n",
      "An individual's genotype is the gene that the individual will show because of the set of alleles it happens to have. In a diploid organism, two alleles make up the individual's genotype. Alleles can be represented in a Punnett square.\n",
      "Example.\n",
      "An example is the gene for blossom colour in many species of flower. A single gene controls the colour of the petals, but there may be several different versions (or alleles) of the gene.\n",
      "In this example, parents have the genotype Bb (capital letters show dominant alleles and lower-case letters to show recessive alleles). If B (capital) is found in their genotype, the flower will be red. Therefore, the only time a flower is not red is when the genotype is bb (there are no capital 'B's).\n",
      "The probability of the flowers having different genotypes are: BB is 25%, Bb is 50%, and bb is 25%. The phenotype of the flower will always be red if a dominant B is in the genotype. Therefore, there is a 25% chance of getting a flower which isn't red, and 75% chance of getting a flower which is red.\n",

Plants use seeds to disperse (spread) the plant across the landscape.\n",

People often wear flowers on their clothes or give flowers as a gift during special occasions, holidays, or rituals, such as the birth of a new baby (or a Christening), at weddings (marriages), at funerals (when a person dies). People often buy flowers from businesses called florists.\n",

      "The genus \"Gladiolus\" contains about 260 species, of which 250 are native to sub-Saharan Africa, mostly South Africa. About 10 species are native to Eurasia. There are 160 species of \"Gladiolus\" endemic in southern Africa and 76 in tropical Africa. The species vary from very small to the spectacular giant flower spikes in commerce.\n",
      "These attractive, perennial herbs are semihardy in temperate climates. They grow from rounded, symmetrical corms, that are enveloped in several layers of brownish, fibrous tunics.\n",
      "Their stems are generally unbranched, producing 1 to 9 narrow, sword-shaped, longitudinal grooved leaves, enclosed in a sheath. The lowest leaf is shortened to a cataphyll. The leaf blades can be plane or cruciform in cross section.\n",
      "The fragrant flower spikes are large and one-sided, with secund, bisexual flowers, each subtended by 2 leathery, green bracts. The sepals and the petals are almost identical in appearance, and are termed tepals. They are united at their base into a tube-shaped structure. The dorsal tepal is the largest, arching over the three stamens. The outer three tepals are narrower. The perianth is funnel-shaped, with the stamens attached to its base. The style has three filiform, spoon-shaped branches, each expanding towards the apex.\n",
      "The ovary is 3-locular with oblong or globose capsules, containing many, winged brown, longitudinally dehiscent seeds. In their center must be noticeable the specific pellet like structure which is the real seed without the fine coat. In some seeds this structure is wrinkled and with black color. These seeds are unable to germinate.\n",
      "These flowers are variously colored, pink to reddish or light purple with white, contrasting markings, or white to cream or orange to red.\n",
      "The South African species were originally pollinated by long-tongued anthrophorine bees, but some changes in the pollination system have occurred, allowing pollination by sunbirds, noctuid and sphingid moths, long-tongued flies and several others. In the temperate zones of Europe many of the hybrid large flowering sorts of gladiolas can be pollinated by small well-known wasps. Actually, They are not very good pollinators because of the large flowers of the plants and the small size of the wasps. Another insect in this zone which can try some of the nectar of the gladioli is the best-known European Hawk-moth \"Macroglossum stellatarum\" which usually pollinates many famous garden flowers like \"Petunia\", \"Zinnia\", \"Dianthus\" and others.\n",

      "Biennial plant\n",
      "A biennial plant is a flowering plant that takes two years to complete its lifecycle. In the first year the plant grows leaves, stems, and roots (vegetative structures); then it enters a period of dormancy over the colder months. Usually, the stem remains very short and the leaves are low to the ground, forming a rosette. Many biennials require a cold treatment, before they will flower. The next spring/summer the stem of the biennial plant becomes much longer. The plant then flowers, produces fruits and seeds before it finally dies. There are far fewer biennials than either perennials or annuals.\n",
      "Under extreme climatic conditions, a biennial plant may complete its lifecycle in a very short period of time (e.g. 3 or 4 months instead of 2 years). This is quite common in vegetable or flower seedlings that were exposed to cold conditions, before they were planted in the ground. This behaviour leads to many normally biennial plants being treated as annuals in some areas.\n",
      "Flowering can be induced in some biennials by application of the plant hormone \"gibberellin\", but this is rarely done commercially.\n",
      "From a gardener's perspective, a plant's status as annual, biennial, or perennial often varies based on location or purpose. Biennials grown for flowers, fruits, or seeds need to be grown for two years. Biennials that are grown for edible leaves or roots are grown as annuals, e.g. beets, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, celery, parsley, and Swiss chard. If a normally biennial plant is grown in extremely harsh conditions, it is likely to be treated as an annual because it will not survive the winter cold. Conversely, an annual grown under extremely favourable conditions may have highly successful seed propagation, giving it the appearance of being biennial or perennial. Some short-lived perennials may appear to be biennial rather than perennial. True biennials flower only once, while many perennials will flower every year once mature.\n",
      "Examples of biennial plants are parsley, \"Lunaria\", silverbeet, sweet William, colic weed, and carrot. The pansy is a biennial often grown as an annual. Plant breeders have produced annual cultivars of several biennials that will flower the first year from seed, e.g. foxglove, stock, and hollyhock.\n",
      "Biennials may be kept alive longer than two years under environmental conditions that prevent them from flowering. Biennial sugar beet was prevented from flowering by not giving it the cold treatment required for flowering. It was kept alive in a greenhouse for 41 months.\n",

      "Allele\n",
      "An allele ((UK), (US)) (from the Greek \"αλληλος allelos\", meaning \"each other\") is a member of a pair or series of different forms of a gene. When people talk about alleles, most often they mean parts of genes that are actually expressed (as part of the genotype of an individual). Sometimes though, the word is used to refer to sequences that are not expressed.\n",
      "An individual's genotype is the gene that the individual will show because of the set of alleles it happens to have. In a diploid organism, two alleles make up the individual's genotype. Alleles can be represented in a Punnett square.\n",
      "Example.\n",
      "An example is the gene for blossom colour in many species of flower. A single gene controls the colour of the petals, but there may be several different versions (or alleles) of the gene.\n",
      "In this example, parents have the genotype Bb (capital letters show dominant alleles and lower-case letters to show recessive alleles). If B (capital) is found in their genotype, the flower will be red. Therefore, the only time a flower is not red is when the genotype is bb (there are no capital 'B's).\n",
      "The probability of the flowers having different genotypes are: BB is 25%, Bb is 50%, and bb is 25%. The phenotype of the flower will always be red if a dominant B is in the genotype. Therefore, there is a 25% chance of getting a flower which isn't red, and 75% chance of getting a flower which is red.\n",

When these new Flower Children returned home at the end of summer, they brought their new clothing, ideas and behaviors to most major cities in the U.S., Canada, Britain, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\n",

      "Flower\n",
      "A flower is a part of a plant. Flowers are also called the bloom or blossom of a plant. It sometimes has a stem - a thin pipe - to support the flower. Flowers have petals. The word \"flower\" is usually used only for the part that produces seeds.\n",
      "In many plants, a flower is its most colourful part. We say the plant 'flowers', 'is flowering' or 'is in flower' when this colourful part begins to grow bigger and open out.\n",
      "There are many different kinds of flowers in different areas in the world. Even in the coldest places, for example the Arctic, flowers can grow during a few months.\n",
      "the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms).\n",
      "For plants.\n",
      "Flowers contains the reproductive organs of a plant. Many flowers are dependent upon the wind to move pollen between flowers of the same species. Other plants rely on insects or bees to move pollen. The role of flowers is to produce seeds. After the seeds are fertilized, portions of the flower develop into a fruit, which contains the seeds. Plants use seeds to disperse (spread) the plant across the landscape.\n",
      "As decoration.\n",
      "Flowers have long been admired and used by humans. Most people think that flowers are beautiful. Many people also love flowers for their fragrances (scents). People enjoy seeing flowers growing in gardens. People also enjoy growing flowers in their backyards, outside their homes. People often wear flowers on their clothes or give flowers as a gift during special occasions, holidays, or rituals, such as the birth of a new baby (or a Christening), at weddings (marriages), at funerals (when a person dies). People often buy flowers from businesses called florists.\n",
      "As a name.\n",
      "Some parents name their children after a flower. A couple of common flower names are: Rose, Lily and Daisy.\n",
      "As food.\n",
      "People also eat some types of flowers. Flower vegetables include broccoli, cauliflower and artichoke. The most expensive spice, saffron, comes from the crocus flower. Other flower spices are cloves and capers. Hops flowers are used to flavor beer. Dandelion flowers are often made into wine.\n",
      "Honey is flower nectar that has been collected and processed by bees. Honey is often named for the type of flower that the bees are using (for example, clover honey). Some people put flowers from nasturtiums, chrysanthemums, or carnations in their food. Flowers can also be made into tea. Dried flowers such as chrysanthemum, rose, jasmine are used to make tea.\n",
      "Special meanings.\n",
      "Some people think that some flowers have special meanings. Lilies make people think of life. Red roses make people think of love, beauty, and passion. Poppies make people think of making people feel better after people have died. In Britain, Australia and Canada, red poppies are worn to remember the soldiers who have died in wars. Daisies make people think of children and innocence.\n",

Other plants rely on insects or bees to move pollen. The role of flowers is to produce seeds. After the seeds are fertilized, portions of the flower develop into a fruit, which contains the seeds. Plants use seeds to disperse (spread) the plant across the landscape.\n",
      "As decoration.\n",
      "Flowers have long been admired and used by humans. Most people think that flowers are beautiful. Many people also love flowers for their fragrances (scents). People enjoy seeing flowers growing in gardens. People also enjoy growing flowers in their backyards, outside their homes. People often wear flowers on their clothes or give flowers as a gift during special occasions, holidays, or rituals, such as the birth of a new baby (or a Christening), at weddings (marriages), at funerals (when a person dies). People often buy flowers from businesses called florists.\n",

      "Honey is flower nectar that has been collected and processed by bees. Honey is often named for the type of flower that the bees are using (for example, clover honey). Some people put flowers from nasturtiums, chrysanthemums, or carnations in their food. Flowers can also be made into tea. Dried flowers such as chrysanthemum, rose, jasmine are used to make tea.\n",
      "Special meanings.\n",
      "Some people think that some flowers have special meanings. Lilies make people think of life. Red roses make people think of love, beauty, and passion.

      "A flower is a part of a plant. Flowers are also called the bloom or blossom of a plant. It sometimes has a stem - a thin pipe - to support the flower. Flowers have petals. The word \"flower\" is usually used only for the part that produces seeds.\n",
      "In many plants, a flower is its most colourful part. We say the plant 'flowers', 'is flowering' or 'is in flower' when this colourful part begins to grow bigger and open out.\n",
      "There are many different kinds of flowers in different areas in the world. Even in the coldest places, for example the Arctic, flowers can grow during a few months.\n",
      "the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms).\n",
      "For plants.\n",
      "Flowers contains the reproductive organs of a plant. Many flowers are dependent upon the wind to move pollen between flowers of the same species. Other plants rely on insects or bees to move pollen. The role of flowers is to produce seeds. After the seeds are fertilized, portions of the flower develop into a fruit, which contains the seeds. Plants use seeds to disperse (spread) the plant across the landscape.\n",
      "As decoration.\n",
      "Flowers have long been admired and used by humans. Most people think that flowers are beautiful. Many people also love flowers for their fragrances (scents). People enjoy seeing flowers growing in gardens. People also enjoy growing flowers in their backyards, outside their homes. People often wear flowers on their clothes or give flowers as a gift during special occasions, holidays, or rituals, such as the birth of a new baby (or a Christening), at weddings (marriages), at funerals (when a person dies). People often buy flowers from businesses called florists.\n",
      "As a name.\n",
      "Some parents name their children after a flower. A couple of common flower names are: Rose, Lily and Daisy.\n",
      "As food.\n",
      "People also eat some types of flowers. Flower vegetables include broccoli, cauliflower and artichoke. The most expensive spice, saffron, comes from the crocus flower. Other flower spices are cloves and capers. Hops flowers are used to flavor beer. Dandelion flowers are often made into wine.\n",
      "Honey is flower nectar that has been collected and processed by bees. Honey is often named for the type of flower that the bees are using (for example, clover honey). Some people put flowers from nasturtiums, chrysanthemums, or carnations in their food. Flowers can also be made into tea. Dried flowers such as chrysanthemum, rose, jasmine are used to make tea.\n",
      "Special meanings.\n",
      "Some people think that some flowers have special meanings. Lilies make people think of life. Red roses make people think of love, beauty, and passion. Poppies make people think of making people feel better after people have died. In Britain, Australia and Canada, red poppies are worn to remember the soldiers who have died in wars. Daisies make people think of children and innocence.\n",

They are perennial herbaceous aestivating plants, with a surface or underground tuber (derived from the hypocotyl) 4-12 cm diameter, which produces leaves in late winter, and flowers in the autumn; the leaves die down during the hottest part of the Mediterranean summer drought to conserve water. Each leaf or flower grows on its own stem, which shoots up from the hypocotyl. The variegation is thought by some botanists to be a form of natural disruptive camouflage to reduce grazing damage by animals.\n",

      "The genus \"Gladiolus\" contains about 260 species, of which 250 are native to sub-Saharan Africa, mostly South Africa. About 10 species are native to Eurasia. There are 160 species of \"Gladiolus\" endemic in southern Africa and 76 in tropical Africa. The species vary from very small to the spectacular giant flower spikes in commerce.\n",
      "These attractive, perennial herbs are semihardy in temperate climates. They grow from rounded, symmetrical corms, that are enveloped in several layers of brownish, fibrous tunics.\n",
      "Their stems are generally unbranched, producing 1 to 9 narrow, sword-shaped, longitudinal grooved leaves, enclosed in a sheath. The lowest leaf is shortened to a cataphyll. The leaf blades can be plane or cruciform in cross section.\n",
      "The fragrant flower spikes are large and one-sided, with secund, bisexual flowers, each subtended by 2 leathery, green bracts. The sepals and the petals are almost identical in appearance, and are termed tepals. They are united at their base into a tube-shaped structure. The dorsal tepal is the largest, arching over the three stamens. The outer three tepals are narrower. The perianth is funnel-shaped, with the stamens attached to its base. The style has three filiform, spoon-shaped branches, each expanding towards the apex.\n",
      "The ovary is 3-locular with oblong or globose capsules, containing many, winged brown, longitudinally dehiscent seeds. In their center must be noticeable the specific pellet like structure which is the real seed without the fine coat. In some seeds this structure is wrinkled and with black color. These seeds are unable to germinate.\n",
      "These flowers are variously colored, pink to reddish or light purple with white, contrasting markings, or white to cream or orange to red.\n",
      "The South African species were originally pollinated by long-tongued anthrophorine bees, but some changes in the pollination system have occurred, allowing pollination by sunbirds, noctuid and sphingid moths, long-tongued flies and several others. In the temperate zones of Europe many of the hybrid large flowering sorts of gladiolas can be pollinated by small well-known wasps. Actually, They are not very good pollinators because of the large flowers of the plants and the small size of the wasps. Another insect in this zone which can try some of the nectar of the gladioli is the best-known European Hawk-moth \"Macroglossum stellatarum\" which usually pollinates many famous garden flowers like \"Petunia\", \"Zinnia\", \"Dianthus\" and others.\n",

      "Biennial plant\n",
      "A biennial plant is a flowering plant that takes two years to complete its lifecycle. In the first year the plant grows leaves, stems, and roots (vegetative structures); then it enters a period of dormancy over the colder months. Usually, the stem remains very short and the leaves are low to the ground, forming a rosette. Many biennials require a cold treatment, before they will flower. The next spring/summer the stem of the biennial plant becomes much longer. The plant then flowers, produces fruits and seeds before it finally dies. There are far fewer biennials than either perennials or annuals.\n",
      "Under extreme climatic conditions, a biennial plant may complete its lifecycle in a very short period of time (e.g. 3 or 4 months instead of 2 years). This is quite common in vegetable or flower seedlings that were exposed to cold conditions, before they were planted in the ground. This behaviour leads to many normally biennial plants being treated as annuals in some areas.\n",
      "Flowering can be induced in some biennials by application of the plant hormone \"gibberellin\", but this is rarely done commercially.\n",
      "From a gardener's perspective, a plant's status as annual, biennial, or perennial often varies based on location or purpose. Biennials grown for flowers, fruits, or seeds need to be grown for two years. Biennials that are grown for edible leaves or roots are grown as annuals, e.g. beets, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, celery, parsley, and Swiss chard. If a normally biennial plant is grown in extremely harsh conditions, it is likely to be treated as an annual because it will not survive the winter cold. Conversely, an annual grown under extremely favourable conditions may have highly successful seed propagation, giving it the appearance of being biennial or perennial. Some short-lived perennials may appear to be biennial rather than perennial. True biennials flower only once, while many perennials will flower every year once mature.\n",
      "Examples of biennial plants are parsley, \"Lunaria\", silverbeet, sweet William, colic weed, and carrot. The pansy is a biennial often grown as an annual. Plant breeders have produced annual cultivars of several biennials that will flower the first year from seed, e.g. foxglove, stock, and hollyhock.\n",
      "Biennials may be kept alive longer than two years under environmental conditions that prevent them from flowering. Biennial sugar beet was prevented from flowering by not giving it the cold treatment required for flowering. It was kept alive in a greenhouse for 41 months.\n",

      "An example is the gene for blossom colour in many species of flower. A single gene controls the colour of the petals, but there may be several different versions (or alleles) of the gene.\n",

If B (capital) is found in their genotype, the flower will be red. Therefore, the only time a flower is not red is when the genotype is bb (there are no capital 'B's).\n",
      "The probability of the flowers having different genotypes are: BB is 25%, Bb is 50%, and bb is 25%. The phenotype of the flower will always be red if a dominant B is in the genotype. Therefore, there is a 25% chance of getting a flower which isn't red, and 75% chance of getting a flower which is red.\n",

Plants use seeds to disperse (spread) the plant across the landscape.\n",

People often wear flowers on their clothes or give flowers as a gift during special occasions, holidays, or rituals, such as the birth of a new baby (or a Christening), at weddings (marriages), at funerals (when a person dies). People often buy flowers from businesses called florists.\n",

They are perennial herbaceous aestivating plants, with a surface or underground tuber (derived from the hypocotyl) 4-12 cm diameter, which produces leaves in late winter, and flowers in the autumn; the leaves die down during the hottest part of the Mediterranean summer drought to conserve water. Each leaf or flower grows on its own stem, which shoots up from the hypocotyl. The variegation is thought by some botanists to be a form of natural disruptive camouflage to reduce grazing damage by animals.\n",

      "The genus \"Gladiolus\" contains about 260 species, of which 250 are native to sub-Saharan Africa, mostly South Africa. About 10 species are native to Eurasia. There are 160 species of \"Gladiolus\" endemic in southern Africa and 76 in tropical Africa. The species vary from very small to the spectacular giant flower spikes in commerce.\n",
      "These attractive, perennial herbs are semihardy in temperate climates. They grow from rounded, symmetrical corms, that are enveloped in several layers of brownish, fibrous tunics.\n",
      "Their stems are generally unbranched, producing 1 to 9 narrow, sword-shaped, longitudinal grooved leaves, enclosed in a sheath. The lowest leaf is shortened to a cataphyll. The leaf blades can be plane or cruciform in cross section.\n",
      "The fragrant flower spikes are large and one-sided, with secund, bisexual flowers, each subtended by 2 leathery, green bracts. The sepals and the petals are almost identical in appearance, and are termed tepals. They are united at their base into a tube-shaped structure. The dorsal tepal is the largest, arching over the three stamens. The outer three tepals are narrower. The perianth is funnel-shaped, with the stamens attached to its base. The style has three filiform, spoon-shaped branches, each expanding towards the apex.\n",
      "The ovary is 3-locular with oblong or globose capsules, containing many, winged brown, longitudinally dehiscent seeds. In their center must be noticeable the specific pellet like structure which is the real seed without the fine coat. In some seeds this structure is wrinkled and with black color. These seeds are unable to germinate.\n",
      "These flowers are variously colored, pink to reddish or light purple with white, contrasting markings, or white to cream or orange to red.\n",
      "The South African species were originally pollinated by long-tongued anthrophorine bees, but some changes in the pollination system have occurred, allowing pollination by sunbirds, noctuid and sphingid moths, long-tongued flies and several others. In the temperate zones of Europe many of the hybrid large flowering sorts of gladiolas can be pollinated by small well-known wasps. Actually, They are not very good pollinators because of the large flowers of the plants and the small size of the wasps. Another insect in this zone which can try some of the nectar of the gladioli is the best-known European Hawk-moth \"Macroglossum stellatarum\" which usually pollinates many famous garden flowers like \"Petunia\", \"Zinnia\", \"Dianthus\" and others.\n",

      "Biennial plant\n",
      "A biennial plant is a flowering plant that takes two years to complete its lifecycle. In the first year the plant grows leaves, stems, and roots (vegetative structures); then it enters a period of dormancy over the colder months. Usually, the stem remains very short and the leaves are low to the ground, forming a rosette. Many biennials require a cold treatment, before they will flower. The next spring/summer the stem of the biennial plant becomes much longer. The plant then flowers, produces fruits and seeds before it finally dies. There are far fewer biennials than either perennials or annuals.\n",
      "Under extreme climatic conditions, a biennial plant may complete its lifecycle in a very short period of time (e.g. 3 or 4 months instead of 2 years). This is quite common in vegetable or flower seedlings that were exposed to cold conditions, before they were planted in the ground. This behaviour leads to many normally biennial plants being treated as annuals in some areas.\n",
      "Flowering can be induced in some biennials by application of the plant hormone \"gibberellin\", but this is rarely done commercially.\n",
      "From a gardener's perspective, a plant's status as annual, biennial, or perennial often varies based on location or purpose. Biennials grown for flowers, fruits, or seeds need to be grown for two years. Biennials that are grown for edible leaves or roots are grown as annuals, e.g. beets, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, celery, parsley, and Swiss chard. If a normally biennial plant is grown in extremely harsh conditions, it is likely to be treated as an annual because it will not survive the winter cold. Conversely, an annual grown under extremely favourable conditions may have highly successful seed propagation, giving it the appearance of being biennial or perennial. Some short-lived perennials may appear to be biennial rather than perennial. True biennials flower only once, while many perennials will flower every year once mature.\n",
      "Examples of biennial plants are parsley, \"Lunaria\", silverbeet, sweet William, colic weed, and carrot. The pansy is a biennial often grown as an annual. Plant breeders have produced annual cultivars of several biennials that will flower the first year from seed, e.g. foxglove, stock, and hollyhock.\n",
      "Biennials may be kept alive longer than two years under environmental conditions that prevent them from flowering. Biennial sugar beet was prevented from flowering by not giving it the cold treatment required for flowering. It was kept alive in a greenhouse for 41 months.\n",

Sometimes though, the word is used to refer to sequences that are not expressed.\n",

      "Example.\n",
      "An example is the gene for blossom colour in many species of flower. A single gene controls the colour of the petals, but there may be several different versions (or alleles) of the gene.\n",
      "In this example, parents have the genotype Bb (capital letters show dominant alleles and lower-case letters to show recessive alleles). If B (capital) is found in their genotype, the flower will be red. Therefore, the only time a flower is not red is when the genotype is bb (there are no capital 'B's).\n",
      "The probability of the flowers having different genotypes are: BB is 25%, Bb is 50%, and bb is 25%. The phenotype of the flower will always be red if a dominant B is in the genotype. Therefore, there is a 25% chance of getting a flower which isn't red, and 75% chance of getting a flower which is red.\n",

      "If a book of a TV show is popular science, then it is about science, but its made so its easy for everyone to understand. It has \"popular\" in its name because its made for the whole \"popul'\"ation\", not just for scientists. Nature documentaries (nature shows) are examples of popular science.\n",
      "Popular science is non-fiction, so it is not the same as \"science fiction\".\n",
      "Popular science is also not the same as \"Science journalism\". Science journalism is what journalists write to report the newest theories and discoveries made in science, but popular science is not always about what is newest.\n",
      "Some famous people who make popular science are Isaac Asimov, Jared Diamond, Stephen Hawking, Bill Nye, and Carl Sagan.\n",
      "Popular science and scientific literature.\n",
      "When scientists write about their work, first they write books and periodicals meant for the same kind of scientists to read-- \"scientific literature\". The purpose of popular science is to show scientific literature in a way that different types of scientists, and people who are not scientists, will easily understand. When people take an idea from scientific literature and change it into popular science, important things about that idea are often left out or added in.\n",
      "Scientific literature is made to seem like the ideas in it are not very new, and that the writer is not sure the idea is true. That way, other scientists will agree with the idea more. But popular science is made to be like other media, so many people will enjoy it. In popular science, ideas are made to sound like they are new, and like scientists all agree with the ideas. If scientific literature and popular science are compared, there is often a big difference. Even if most people agree about the subject, there is still a difference.\n",
      "Some popular science is made by people who do not understand the subject well. Some is made by people who have a strong bias. Some is part science and part pseudoscience. It can be hard for someone who is not an expert to tell which works of popular science are misleading.\n",

The university was started in 1817 in Detroit, about 20 years before the Michigan became a state, and moved to Ann Arbor in 1837. It is the state's oldest university and the main campus; there are two other campuses—the University of Michigan-Flint and the University of Michigan–Dearborn.\n",
      "The university is known around the world, its students being famous people such as U.S. President Gerald Ford, Supreme Court Justices, as well as many heads of states around the world. It is now ranked 18th in the world by \"The Times Higher Education-QS World University Rankings,\" and 21st by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University Institute for Higher Education rankings. In its last survey in 1995, the National Research Council ranked UM 3rd in the United States and is called one of the first eight Public Ivys. The university also has one of the largest research budgets or spending money of any American university and the largest number of living alumni or former students, at 460,000. UM athletic teams are known as very good, especially in football, men's basketball, and ice hockey.\n",
      "History.\n",
      "The University of Michigan was started in Detroit in 1817 as the Catholepistemiad, or University of Michigania, by the governor and judges of Michigan Territory. Ann Arbor had set aside 40 acres (16 ha) that it hoped would become the site for a new state capitol, but it gave this land to the university when Lansing was chosen as the state capital. The university moved to Ann Arbor in 1837. The original 40 acres became part of today's Central Campus. The first classes in Ann Arbor were held in 1841, with six freshmen and a sophomore, taught by two professors or teachers. Eleven students graduated in the first class in 1845. By 1866, 1,205 students went to UM. Women were first allowed in 1870, making UM the first major university to allow women to go to school. James B. Angell, was the university's president from 1871 to 1909, made UM's teachings include subjects such as dentistry, architecture, engineering, government, and medicine. UM also became the first American university to teach in the seminar style.\n",
      "From 1900 to 1920 many new buildings were built on campus, including buildings for the dental and pharmacy programs, a chemistry building, a building for the natural sciences, Hill Auditorium, large hospital and library buildings, and two residence halls. The university built up its reputation for research in 1920 by rebuilding the College of Engineering and making a group of 100 industrialists, or businessmen, to help guide research. UM's reputation as a very good national university also began to grow at this time. The university became a favorite other choice for Jewish students from New York in the 1920s and 1930s when the Ivy League schools made a limit to the number of Jews to be admitted. Because of this, UM gained the nickname \"Harvard of the West,\" which became commonly joked about in reverse after John F. Kennedy called himself \"a graduate of the Michigan of the East, Harvard University\" in a speech.\n",
      "In World War II, UM's research grew to include U.S. Navy projects like researching proximity fuzes, PT boats, and radar jamming. By 1950, 21,000 students were at UM. As the Cold War and the Space Race started, UM got many government grants for research and helped to create peacetime uses for nuclear energy. Now, much of that work, as well as research into other energy types, is done by the Memorial Phoenix Project.\n",
      "On October 14, 1960, Presidential candidate John F. Kennedy put out the idea of what became the Peace Corps on the steps of Michigan Union. Lyndon B. Johnson's speech about his Great Society program also occurred at UM. Also during the 1960s, UM saw many protests by student groups. On March 24, 1965, a group of UM faculty members and 3,000 students held the nation's first ever faculty-led \"teach-in\" to protest against American policy in Southeast Asia. Because of a series of sit-ins in 1966 by \"Voice\"–the campus political party of Students for a Democratic Society–UM's administration banned sit-ins. This led 1,500 students to have another one-hour sit-in the LSA Building, which then housed the administrative offices. Former UM student and important architect Alden B. Dow designed the current Fleming Administration Building, which was completed in 1968. The building's plans were drawn in the early 1960s, before student activism created a concern for safety. Nevertheless, the Fleming Building's narrow windows, all located above the first floor, and castle-like outside led to a campus rumor that it was made to be riot-proof. Dow denied the rumors, saying the small windows were made to be use less energy.\n",
      "During the 1970s, large budget limits made it hard on the university's physical development; however, the 1980s saw a surge in money given to research in the social and physical sciences. At that time, the university's work in the anti-missile Strategic Defense Initiative and investments in South Africa caused anger on campus. During the 1980s and 1990s, the university used many resources to help rebuild its large hospital area and improve the academic buildings on the North Campus. The university also made computer and information technology on the campus important.\n",
      "Academics.\n",
      "The university has 26,083 undergraduate and 14,959 graduate students in 600 academic programs, and each year about 5,400 new students go to UM. Students come from all 50 U.S. states and more than 100 countries. 98% of the university's class of 2006 had a high school GPA of 3.0 and higher, while the middle 50% of the class had a high school GPA of 3.60 to 3.90. The middle 50% of people applying had an SAT score of about 1920–2180 and an ACT score of 27–31, with AP credit given to over 3000 freshmen students. About 22% of newly undergraduates and 25% of all undergraduates are members of ethnic minority groups.\n",
      "About 65% of undergraduate students go to the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LS&A), while the College of Engineering has about 20%. Less than 3% of undergraduate students go to the Ross School of Business. The rest of the undergraduate students go to the smaller schools, including the School of Kinesiology, School of Nursing, the School of Natural Resources and Environment, and the School of Art and Design. Most graduate students go to the Rackham Graduate School, the College of Engineering, the Law School, the Ross School of Business, and the Medical School. The Medical School works with the University of Michigan Health System, which makes up the University's three hospitals, a lot of the outpatient clinics, and many places for medical care, research, and education. Other academic units are the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning and the Schools of Dentistry, Education, Information, Music, Theatre & Dance, Natural Resources and Environment, Public Health, and Social Work, of which Social Work has been ranked first by the \"U.S. News and World Report\" every year since 1994.\n",

      "Human science is the science of humans: what makes them different from animals, and their limits, which tend to be the same as those of other animals. Because human bodies are animal bodies, human science is part of biology which leads to Life Science. However human behaviour includes the use of words, measures, numbers, knowing time and having memory, and such habits as trade - thus economics and psychology are considered to be part of human science. A general human science is anthropology which studies only the differences between humans and near relatives.\n",
      "One important debate in human science is whether the exchange of culture (or in economics instructional capital), is only among humans or if it also goes on among our Great Ape near relatives. If so, then culture is part of primatology and there is no clear line between human science and life sciences.\n",
      "Another name for human science is Social Science, since the most complex thing about humans is how they relate to each other in society. The most general social science is ethics, or economics, depending on your point of view.\n",
      "However, life science also deals with humans as objects of study (notably in medicine), while hard science such as chemistry deals with humans as the observer who \"does\" the study - sets the scale at which observation can happen, incurs observer effects - as studied in philosophy of science.\n",
      "Often sciences have different names based on whether they study humans or not. For instance economics is the study of how humans make a living, while ecology is the study of how non-humans make a living. Medicine is normally restricted to humans while veterinary medicine refers to the same techniques made on other species. One relies more on ethics and less on economics when dealing with humans, at least according to any ethical tradition.\n",
      "The living, social, and sensory observing aspects of humans are probably all part of the human sciences to the degree they affect how humans view themselves.\n",
      "Specific human sciences are (in addition to anthropology and ethics and economics) include psychology, sociology and linguistics. There is debate as to whether mathematics is something human or if it is universal - see philosophy of mathematics on this.\n",

      "Other features of science.\n",

Some philosophers and scientists say that scientific theories are only accepted as long as they are the best explanation for the data that exists, and when theories no longer explain the data, they are discarded and replaced. Other people say that sometimes scientists will make a theory better rather than discard it, or that they will keep on using the theory hoping that it will be made better eventually.\n",
      "Scientists compete with each other. Scientists check each other's work. Scientists try to make better explanations for the data.\n",

      "Science is a way to get knowledge by discarding what is not true.\n",
      "Scientists must be very careful to make explanations that fit well with what they observe and measure. They compete to provide better explanations. An explanation might be interesting or pleasing, but if it does not agree with what other scientists really see and measure, they will try to find a better explanation.\n",
      "Other scientists check their ideas to see if the real observations, measurements, and tests show if they are right or wrong. Peer review and repeating experiments is the only way to be sure the knowledge is correct.\n",
      "Science makes models of nature, models of our universe, and medicine. There are many different sciences with their own names. However it is not right to say \"science says\" any one thing. Science is a process, not just the facts and rules believed at one time.\n",

      "Tsing Hua University\n",
      "Tsing Hua University or THU (simplified Chinese: 清华大学; traditional Chinese: 清華大學; pinyin: Qīng Huá Dà Xué), is a university in Beijing, People's Republic of China. It is regarded as one of the best and most selective universities in China. It was established in 1911 as a school for Chinese graduates wanting to go further with their studies at universities in other countries, expecially America and the UK.\n",
      "History.\n",
      "Tsing Hua University was opened in Beijing, China in 1911 on the site of a former royal garden belonging to a prince. It was first a \"preparatory school\", a school for preparation, for students to be later sent by the government to study in America. The people who graduated were transferred directly to American schools as juniors upon graduation.\n",
      "In 1925, the school established its College Department and started its research institute on Chinese Study. In 1928, the name officially changed to National Tsing Hua University (NTHU).\n",
      "During the Second World War in 1937, Tsing Hua University, along with Peking University and Nankai University, merged to form Chang Sha Temporary University in Chang Sha, which later became National Southwestern Associated University in Kunming of Yunnan province. After the war, Tsing Hua moved back to Beijing and resumed its operation.\n",
      "The communist victory at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 led to the creation of the People's Republic of China (PRC), so the university's President Mei Yi Qi and some professors went to Taiwan where they established the National Tsing Hua Institute of Nuclear Technology in 1955, which later became National Tsing Hua University.\n",
      "In 1952, the communist government regrouped the country's higher education institutions in an attempt to build a Soviet style system, with individual institutions tending to specialise in a certain field of study. TsingHua University was disassembled, losing its law school, school of agriculture, school of sciences and humanities, and became a polytechnic engineering university. Even so, the University remained in the top tier schools in China (Many Chinese scholars regards that its only rival is Peking Unviersity). In many years following this regroup, the school was often referred to as the \"MIT of China\". But since the 1980s, the university began to incorporate a multidisciplinary system. As a result, a lot of schools were built and rebuilt. These included the School of Science, School of Economics and Management, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, School of Law, School of Public Administration, and the School of Art. Only two colleges charge tuition to its graduate students; the law school and the Academy of Arts and Design.\n",
      "During the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, the university became a battlefield between different sects of Mao's Red Guards (China) and a stronghold of the radicals. It did not resume its normal operation until 1977 when the Cultural Revolution was officially put to an end.\n",
      "Since 1977, the university has enjoyed rich government funding and policy support which greatly improved its facilities. Since 1978, it has flourished with the re-establishment of the departments in sciences, economics and management, and the humanities. Its graduate school has been recognized nationally, ranking first in the National Evaluation of Graduate Schools. The School of Continuing Education makes the best use of modern information technologies, as well as the advanced educational resources at Tsing Hua.\n",
      "Present.\n",
      "Most Chinese university rankings place TsingHua first in China. It attracts the most talented students of the nation and enjoys the best engineering and applied sciences programs in China, occupying a position similar to MIT, Stanford, and Princeton in the US. Peking Union Medical College of Tsinghua University is likewise regarded as the best medical school in the country. Tsinghua's longtime rival Peking University is better known for natural sciences, social sciences, law, and liberal arts, somewhat similar to the Ivy League schools of Yale, Harvard, and the University of Pennsylvania.\n",
      "Admission to Tsinghua is highly competitive. The majority of selected students are national scholars and among the brightest high school graduates in the country. Many of China's top scientists, engineers, politicians and business leaders are among Tsinghua alumni. The current Chinese president, Hu Jintao, is a former Tsinghua student who graduated with a degree in hydraulic engineering in 1964.\n",
      "There are voices of criticism that nowadays, the university's top graduates are more likely to enroll at prestigious US university and research institutions.\n",
      "As of 2003, Tsinghua University had 12 colleges and 48 departments, 41 research institutes, 35 research centers, and 167 laboratories, including 15 national key laboratories. In September 2006, Peking Union Medical College was renamed to Peking Union Medical College, Tsinghua University. The university offers 51 bachelor's degree programs, 139 master's degree programs and 107 Ph.D. programs. Recently, Tsinghua has become the first Chinese university to offer a Master of Laws program in American law, through a cooperative venture with the Temple University Beasley School of Law. The university is a member of LAOTSE, an international network of leading universities in Europe and Asia. Each year, the University celebrates the Intellectual Property Summer Institute in cooperation with Franklin Pierce Law Center of Concord, New Hampshire.\n",
      "On April 12, 2007, Tsinghua University's School of Economics and Management became the first business school in the Chinese mainland to earn AACSB accreditation. Former Premier Zhu Rongji was the founding dean of the school.\n",
      "The University's Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology is on a separate campus in a northern suburb of Beijing.\n",
      "Tsinghua is the Chinese university where former United States Vice President Al Gore lectured at in his documentary, An Inconvenient Truth. Viewers can see the university lecture hall, with its well-known purple seats.\n",
      "Campus.\n",
      "The campus of Tsinghua University is located in northwest Beijing, in the Haidian district which was designated for universities.\n",
      "It is located on the former site of Qing Dynasty royal gardens and retains some Chinese-style landscaping as well as some traditional buildings, but many of its buildings are Western-style reflecting the American influence in its history. It is known throughout China for having one of the most beautiful campuses.\n",
      "The university's architect T. Chuang, a 1914 graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, modeled his designs for the quadrangle and auditorium of Tsinghua on the Illinois campus, specifically imitating Foellinger Auditorium, located on the quad at the University of Illinois.\n",
      "Tsinghua Alma Mater.\n",
      "In 1923, another version of the school alma mater with lyrics in Chinese (by Prof. Wang Luan Xiang, a Chinese language professor of Tsinghua) was composed by Mrs. Zhang Hui Zhen and was well received by the students and faculty. The song was then adopted as the school's official Alma Mater.\n",

      "Fecund universes\n",
      "Fecund universes is a multiverse theory of Lee Smolin. It relies on models of our universe and statistics from astrophysics but is more correctly a theory of cosmology.\n",
      "In this theory, collapsing stars, or black holes, are always creating new universes with slightly different laws of physics. Because these laws are only slightly different, each is assumed to be like a mutation of the original universe, as if each universe was a kind of single-celled organism. It would reproduce by \"splitting\" in some sense.\n",
      "This theory relies on many models of our universe to model these \"mutated\" alternative universes, the ones that Smolin supposes are generated or \"spun off\" by black holes.\n",
      "No human can ever be part of any of these \"other\" universes. Observations from astrophysics can only say if the black holes exist or are common, and give some idea of how much the laws of physics can vary and still let the new universes produce new black holes.\n",
      "Smolin predicts that there would be many black holes in the universe humans can see, since they are likely in a very late born universe, by simple probability. If there are many black holes, that is evidence for his theory,\n",
      "As this shows, cosmology has a very different standard of evidence and burden of proof than is required for models of our universe only, which humans (using mathematics) can observe and exchange knowledge on.\n",
      "It is hard to separate science from religion on such questions. It may be a simple matter of preference whether one wants to see one's universe as part of a system like biology or like mechanics - clockwork. Smolin's theory is important mostly because it challenges the mechanistic paradigm.\n",
      "Even if it is wrong, it raises the idea that living beings might have to see their universe as also living to be able to understand or care about it at all. Some compare Smolin's theory to Gaia philosophy which combines biology, geology and ecology to explain the Earth, our planet, as a living thing. If both are right, humans are on a living planet in a living universe. This idea is very appealing - which does not mean it is really \"right\". Some think both are a kind of religion.\n",

      "A fictional universe is an made up world that is used as the setting for one or (more commonly) many works of fiction. It is often used in books but can be used in any form used to tell a story, for example role-playing games, television or movies. It can be said that every work of fiction makes a world of its own. A fictional universe is used when things in a story become a part either of other stories, or of games or other things.\n",
      "Fictional universes are most often used in science fiction and fantasy stories but they can be used in any type of fiction. A fictional universe usually has certain things in them that make them different from the real world. These things could affect anything from cities the author created to entire galaxies. In most fictional universes, the laws of physics are different to let things exist which commonly do not, for example, magic or space travel to other planets. Fictional universes may also take place in any time period during the past, present, or future.\n",
      "Examples of fictional universes.\n",
      "There are many examples of fictional universes. They are often used to provide a common theme to many different types of things.\n",
      "The \"Star Wars\" expanded universe.\n",
      "The \"Star Wars\" expanded universe is a fictional universe that was started from the first Star Wars movie ' in 1977. The movie created a universe full of people and planets with space travel to other worlds, Alien creatures, and a type of magic. Two later movies were made that took place in the same fictional universe the movie created. After that, many books, comic books, and video games were made that created new characters, places and stories all taking place in that same universe. Most of this took place either during the time of the first three movies or created more of the story of the universe as time passed after the story told in the movies ended. Three additional movies were also made that took place in the same universe, but at an earlier period of time. This lead to writers creating more stories about the history of the characters and their worlds.\n",
      "The \"Buffyverse\".\n",
      "In 1997, writer and director Joss Whedon created a television series called \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" from a movie he had written several years before. The stories of the television series mainly took place in the fictional town of Sunnydale, California. The series had creature such as vampires and werewolves. It also dealt with magic. Over time, as the series went on and more and more stories were written, it developed into what is called the \"Buffyverse\". While the focus of the main story and its characters was just one town, the events of the story and the rules the universe followed had effects on other towns, parallel worlds, other dimensions, and even other periods of time. Characters from the show were used to make another show, \"Angel\" which took place in Los Angeles but still had demons and vampires. The universe has been used in many books as well as several video games. While the series was still being made, several other writers were also making comic books which told stories that took place during the same time of the series. Whedon himself wrote a series of comic books dealing with a vampire slayer named Fray from several hundred years in the future. Whedon is currently writing a new comic which is often nicknamed \"Season Eight\". It tells the stories of what happens to the characters from the series after its seven seasons as a television series.\n",
      "Other examples.\n",
      "Nearly every type of fiction has its own created universe. Many of these examples started in one category and now exist in many of them. For example, Harry Potter started out as a series of books then moved to movies and then video games.\n",

      "Philosophy of science\n",
      "Philosophy of science is the part of philosophy that studies sciences. Philosophers who are interested in philosophy of science try to explain how a human knowledge, that means all that we are able to understand, could be a science (by induction and observation, by deduction, or by an other method ?), what kind of explanation is science and what exactly science could teach us about nature and universe.\n",
      "Popular ideas about science.\n",
      "The word “science” is used in everyday life language in a lot of domains that don't seem to concern directly philosophy of science. For example, when one says that science proves something, one means that this thing is absolutely true. Advertising uses so the word “science” to give to some object more value, because one believes that if science says that a product has a certain property, then it \"must have\" this property.\n",
      "More generally, science is conceived like something as a knowledge about the world that we must believe. And we think usually that such a belief is right because scientifical truths are proved by direct observation of the facts. In this view, a scientist simply describes what he observes by the means of his senses, that is to say, what he can observe in experience.\n",
      "A “naive” conception of science.\n",
      "For the common sense, then, science begins with observations: all scientific knowledges come from the facts of experience, and theories are produced by the observation of this facts and could then be tested by prediction.\n",
      "---> INDUCTION -----> LAWS AND THEORIES -----> DEDUCTION --->\n",
      "FACTS OF EXPERIENCE PREDICTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS\n",
      "Although the majority of philosophers don't think that this conception could be true, it shows to us the essential notions of philosophy of science: fact, induction, law, and so on. The aim of the philosophy of science is to understand what we really mean by those notions and how we could define them for justify the scientifical knowledge.\n",
      "Universal laws.\n",
      "If such a regularity is observed at all times and all places, it is then expressed in a form called \"universal law\". A universal law says to us that when something is, at any times and any places, then an another thing must be. For example, if \"fire is hot\" is an universal law, when there is (or was or will be) fire in a place of the universe, it's absolutely certain that, in all cases, fire \"is hot\".\n",
      "In this logical expression, (x) means \"all x\", that is to say, \"in any case where there is a x\". x itself is what is called a variable, that is to say, that it can refer to a lot of things, for example, \"some material body.\" Px means that \"x is P\" or \"has the property P\", and Qx means that \"x is Q\" or \"has the property Q\". The symbol ⊃ links Px to Qx, and corresponds to the English \"if... then...\" We can then read the expression \"(Px ⊃ Qx)\" in this way: \"if x is P, then x is also Q.\"\n",
      "Rudolf Carnap gives the following illustration for understand this logical expression: \"For every body x, if that body is heated, that body will expand\". This illustration is the law of thermal expansion. Of course, this sentence is a very simplified formulation of this law.\n",
      "A universal law can then be describe as a law that says that if there is a x, and if x is P (or has the property P), then x is Q (or has the property Q). Such a description is the simplest one, but doesn't describe all kind of scientific laws.\n",
      "Statistical laws.\n",
      "The symbol formula_2 is a \"exclusive disjunction\", and, in this example, it means that \"x is Q\" is true or \"x is R\" is true, but when \"x is Q\" is true, \"x is R\" is false, and when \"x is R\" is true, \"x is Q\" is false. We know that one or the other must be true, but we don't able to determine simply by the means of a universal law which of them is true and which of them is false.\n",
      "However, even in such a case, a kind of law is sometimes possible. Indeed, by counting boys and girls, we know that about half of the children born each year are girls. Therefore, there is a measure of the fact that each child is a boy or a girl, and this measure is a law that is called a \"statistical law\".\n",
      "What teachs us exactly a statistical law ? It teaches us that a fact happens a certain number of times, what is called a \"frequency\", and it defines the \"probability\" that the fact happens. Therefore, if x is a child, if we don't know if this child is a boy or a girl, however we know that half a time a child is a boy.\n",
      "Facts and laws.\n",
      "When we know an universal or a statistical law, we think that we have some knowlegde about objects of the world. Both kind of laws learn us something about what is called \"facts.\" A fact is a singular thing or a singular event; for example, \"this morning, the sun rose\" is a fact, and we can express this fact by a sentence. When we know a fact, we have only the knowledge of this fact in this singularity, and therefore such a sentence don't tell us why that is so.\n",
      "1 is the universal law we want to apply to \"a\". \"a\" is a particular object.\n",
      "2 means that \"a\" has the property P: for example, we have observe that \"a is P\".\n",
      "3 is the deduction that logically follows 1 and 2: if a has the property P (2), then a has the property Q (3). Therefore, if we know 1 (the law that explains some facts) and 2 (a fact that corresponds to Px), we can predict 3 (a new fact) and explain it by 1.\n",
      "The problem of induction.\n",
      "Scientific laws allow men to discover and predict new facts. But a more fundamental question, for philosophers and for scientists, is to understand how we can generalize our observations, and if this kind of generalisations that we call laws are really valid.\n",
      "As we have seen, for the naive conception of science, laws come directly from facts of experience. If we observe a lot of times a fact A in various situations, and if we observe that all A we have seen have the property B, then we could conclude that all A must have the property B. This is the basic formulation of the principle of induction.\n",

      "On June 8, 1912; Laemmle merged IMP with eight smaller companies to form the Universal Film Manufacturing Company, introducing the word \"universal\" into the organization's name. Among them were Mark Dintinfass, Charles Baumann and Adam Kessel, and Pat Powers. The name was later changed to Universal Pictures Company, Inc.\n",
      "Following the westward trend of the industry, in 1915, Laemmle opened the world's largest motion picture production facility, Universal City Studios, on a 230-acre (0.9 km²) converted farm just over the Cahuenga Pass from Hollywood.\n",
      "Other facilities.\n",
      "In 1926, Universal also opened a production unit in Germany, Deutsche Universal-Film AG, under the direction of Joe Pasternak. This unit produced 3–4 films per year until 1936, migrating to Hungary and then Austria in the face of Hitler's increasing domination of central Europe. With the advent of sound, these productions were made in the German language or, occasionally, Hungarian or Polish. In the USA, Universal Pictures did not distribute any of this subsidiary's films, but at least some of them were exhibited through other, independent, foreign-language film distributors based in New York, without benefit of English subtitles. Nazi persecution and a change in ownership for the parent Universal Pictures organization resulted in the dissolution of this subsidiary.\n",
      "The Laemmles lose control.\n",
      "Taking on the task of modernizing and upgrading a film conglomerate in the depths of the depression was risky, and for a time Universal slipped into receivership. The theater chain was scrapped, but Carl, Jr. held fast to distribution, studio and production operations.\n",
      "The end.\n",
      "The end for the Laemmles came with a lavish remake of \"Show Boat\", featuring several stars from the Broadway stage version, which began production in late 1935. However, Carl, Jr.'s spending habits alarmed company stockholders, especially after the costly flop of \"Sutter's Gold\" earlier in the year.\n",
      "Problems.\n",
      "They would not allow production to start on \"Show Boat\" unless the Laemmles obtained a loan. Universal was forced to seek a $750,000 production loan from the Standard Capital Corporation, pledging the Laemmle family's controlling interest in Universal as collateral. It was the first time in Universal's 26-year history that it had borrowed money for a production. Production problems resulted in a $300,000 overrun. When Standard called the loan in, a cash-strapped Universal couldn't pay.\n",
      "Results.\n",
      "\"Show Boat\" was released in 1936 and is widely considered to be one of the greatest film musicals of all time. However, it was not enough to save the Laemmles, who were unceremoniously removed from the company they had founded.\n",
      "MCA takes over.\n",
      "By the late 1950s, the motion picture business was in trouble. The combination of the studio/theater-chain break-up and the rise of television saw the mass audience drift away, probably forever. The Music Corporation of America (better known as MCA), mainly a talent agency, had also become a powerful television producer, renting space at Republic Studios for its Revue Studios subsidiary. After a period of complete shutdown, a moribund Universal agreed to sell its (by now) 360-acre (1.5 km²) studio lot to MCA in 1958, for $11 million. Although MCA owned the studio lot, but not Universal Pictures, it was increasingly influential on Universal's product. The studio lot was upgraded and modernized, while MCA clients like Doris Day, Lana Turner, and Cary Grant were signed to Universal Pictures contracts.\n",
      "First hits.\n",
      "Though Universal's film unit did produce occasional hits, among them \"Airport\", \"The Sting\", \"American Graffiti\", and a blockbuster that restored the company's fortunes, \"Jaws\", Universal in the 1970s was primarily a television studio. Weekly series production was the workhorse of the company. There would be other film hits like ', \"Back to the Future\", and \"Jurassic Park\", but overall the film business was still hit-and-miss. In the early 1970s, Universal teamed up with Paramount Pictures to form Cinema International Corporation, which distributed films by Paramount and Universal worldwide. It was replaced by United International Pictures in 1981, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer joined the fold.\n",
      "Universal's library.\n",
      "Universal, like any other major movie studio, owns a huge library.\n",
      "Content.\n",
      "The company owns the libraries of USA Films, October Films, and the 1996-1999 films by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment (MGM owns most of the pre-1996 PolyGram library, though Universal owns a few films from that era as well) and its subsidiaries, as well as (through parent NBC Universal) much of the post-1973 NBC library of shows and made-for-TV movies.\n",
      "It also owns several films made by others, including some pre-1952 United Artists material, an Alfred Hitchcock feature originally released by Warner Bros. - \"Rope\", and the UK rights to most of the RKO Pictures library.\n",
      "Notes on early partners.\n",
      "For several years some of these junior partners carried considerable weight within Universal; inevitably factions and rivalries were the rule. At least one version of corporate history claims that the twenty-year-old Irving Thalberg rose so quickly because he told subordinates that he alone spoke for Carl Laemmle in making production decisions, while the others were more concerned with battling among themselves.\n",

      "Popular science and scientific literature.\n",
      "When scientists write about their work, first they write books and periodicals meant for the same kind of scientists to read-- \"scientific literature\". The purpose of popular science is to show scientific literature in a way that different types of scientists, and people who are not scientists, will easily understand. When people take an idea from scientific literature and change it into popular science, important things about that idea are often left out or added in.\n",
      "Scientific literature is made to seem like the ideas in it are not very new, and that the writer is not sure the idea is true. That way, other scientists will agree with the idea more. But popular science is made to be like other media, so many people will enjoy it. In popular science, ideas are made to sound like they are new, and like scientists all agree with the ideas. If scientific literature and popular science are compared, there is often a big difference. Even if most people agree about the subject, there is still a difference.\n",
      "Some popular science is made by people who do not understand the subject well. Some is made by people who have a strong bias. Some is part science and part pseudoscience. It can be hard for someone who is not an expert to tell which works of popular science are misleading.\n",

It is the state's oldest university and the main campus; there are two other campuses—the University of Michigan-Flint and the University of Michigan–Dearborn.\n",
      "The university is known around the world, its students being famous people such as U.S. President Gerald Ford, Supreme Court Justices, as well as many heads of states around the world. It is now ranked 18th in the world by \"The Times Higher Education-QS World University Rankings,\" and 21st by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University Institute for Higher Education rankings. In its last survey in 1995, the National Research Council ranked UM 3rd in the United States and is called one of the first eight Public Ivys. The university also has one of the largest research budgets or spending money of any American university and the largest number of living alumni or former students, at 460,000. UM athletic teams are known as very good, especially in football, men's basketball, and ice hockey.\n",
      "History.\n",
      "The University of Michigan was started in Detroit in 1817 as the Catholepistemiad, or University of Michigania, by the governor and judges of Michigan Territory. Ann Arbor had set aside 40 acres (16 ha) that it hoped would become the site for a new state capitol, but it gave this land to the university when Lansing was chosen as the state capital. The university moved to Ann Arbor in 1837. The original 40 acres became part of today's Central Campus. The first classes in Ann Arbor were held in 1841, with six freshmen and a sophomore, taught by two professors or teachers. Eleven students graduated in the first class in 1845. By 1866, 1,205 students went to UM. Women were first allowed in 1870, making UM the first major university to allow women to go to school. James B. Angell, was the university's president from 1871 to 1909, made UM's teachings include subjects such as dentistry, architecture, engineering, government, and medicine. UM also became the first American university to teach in the seminar style.\n",
      "From 1900 to 1920 many new buildings were built on campus, including buildings for the dental and pharmacy programs, a chemistry building, a building for the natural sciences, Hill Auditorium, large hospital and library buildings, and two residence halls. The university built up its reputation for research in 1920 by rebuilding the College of Engineering and making a group of 100 industrialists, or businessmen, to help guide research. UM's reputation as a very good national university also began to grow at this time. The university became a favorite other choice for Jewish students from New York in the 1920s and 1930s when the Ivy League schools made a limit to the number of Jews to be admitted. Because of this, UM gained the nickname \"Harvard of the West,\" which became commonly joked about in reverse after John F. Kennedy called himself \"a graduate of the Michigan of the East, Harvard University\" in a speech.\n",
      "In World War II, UM's research grew to include U.S. Navy projects like researching proximity fuzes, PT boats, and radar jamming. By 1950, 21,000 students were at UM. As the Cold War and the Space Race started, UM got many government grants for research and helped to create peacetime uses for nuclear energy. Now, much of that work, as well as research into other energy types, is done by the Memorial Phoenix Project.\n",
      "On October 14, 1960, Presidential candidate John F. Kennedy put out the idea of what became the Peace Corps on the steps of Michigan Union. Lyndon B. Johnson's speech about his Great Society program also occurred at UM. Also during the 1960s, UM saw many protests by student groups. On March 24, 1965, a group of UM faculty members and 3,000 students held the nation's first ever faculty-led \"teach-in\" to protest against American policy in Southeast Asia. Because of a series of sit-ins in 1966 by \"Voice\"–the campus political party of Students for a Democratic Society–UM's administration banned sit-ins. This led 1,500 students to have another one-hour sit-in the LSA Building, which then housed the administrative offices. Former UM student and important architect Alden B. Dow designed the current Fleming Administration Building, which was completed in 1968. The building's plans were drawn in the early 1960s, before student activism created a concern for safety. Nevertheless, the Fleming Building's narrow windows, all located above the first floor, and castle-like outside led to a campus rumor that it was made to be riot-proof. Dow denied the rumors, saying the small windows were made to be use less energy.\n",
      "During the 1970s, large budget limits made it hard on the university's physical development; however, the 1980s saw a surge in money given to research in the social and physical sciences. At that time, the university's work in the anti-missile Strategic Defense Initiative and investments in South Africa caused anger on campus. During the 1980s and 1990s, the university used many resources to help rebuild its large hospital area and improve the academic buildings on the North Campus. The university also made computer and information technology on the campus important.\n",
      "Academics.\n",
      "The university has 26,083 undergraduate and 14,959 graduate students in 600 academic programs, and each year about 5,400 new students go to UM. Students come from all 50 U.S. states and more than 100 countries. 98% of the university's class of 2006 had a high school GPA of 3.0 and higher, while the middle 50% of the class had a high school GPA of 3.60 to 3.90. The middle 50% of people applying had an SAT score of about 1920–2180 and an ACT score of 27–31, with AP credit given to over 3000 freshmen students. About 22% of newly undergraduates and 25% of all undergraduates are members of ethnic minority groups.\n",
      "About 65% of undergraduate students go to the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LS&A), while the College of Engineering has about 20%. Less than 3% of undergraduate students go to the Ross School of Business. The rest of the undergraduate students go to the smaller schools, including the School of Kinesiology, School of Nursing, the School of Natural Resources and Environment, and the School of Art and Design. Most graduate students go to the Rackham Graduate School, the College of Engineering, the Law School, the Ross School of Business, and the Medical School. The Medical School works with the University of Michigan Health System, which makes up the University's three hospitals, a lot of the outpatient clinics, and many places for medical care, research, and education. Other academic units are the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning and the Schools of Dentistry, Education, Information, Music, Theatre & Dance, Natural Resources and Environment, Public Health, and Social Work, of which Social Work has been ranked first by the \"U.S. News and World Report\" every year since 1994.\n",

      "Human science is the science of humans: what makes them different from animals, and their limits, which tend to be the same as those of other animals. Because human bodies are animal bodies, human science is part of biology which leads to Life Science. However human behaviour includes the use of words, measures, numbers, knowing time and having memory, and such habits as trade - thus economics and psychology are considered to be part of human science. A general human science is anthropology which studies only the differences between humans and near relatives.\n",
      "One important debate in human science is whether the exchange of culture (or in economics instructional capital), is only among humans or if it also goes on among our Great Ape near relatives. If so, then culture is part of primatology and there is no clear line between human science and life sciences.\n",
      "Another name for human science is Social Science, since the most complex thing about humans is how they relate to each other in society. The most general social science is ethics, or economics, depending on your point of view.\n",
      "However, life science also deals with humans as objects of study (notably in medicine), while hard science such as chemistry deals with humans as the observer who \"does\" the study - sets the scale at which observation can happen, incurs observer effects - as studied in philosophy of science.\n",
      "Often sciences have different names based on whether they study humans or not. For instance economics is the study of how humans make a living, while ecology is the study of how non-humans make a living. Medicine is normally restricted to humans while veterinary medicine refers to the same techniques made on other species. One relies more on ethics and less on economics when dealing with humans, at least according to any ethical tradition.\n",
      "The living, social, and sensory observing aspects of humans are probably all part of the human sciences to the degree they affect how humans view themselves.\n",
      "Specific human sciences are (in addition to anthropology and ethics and economics) include psychology, sociology and linguistics. There is debate as to whether mathematics is something human or if it is universal - see philosophy of mathematics on this.\n",

      "Popular science and scientific literature.\n",
      "When scientists write about their work, first they write books and periodicals meant for the same kind of scientists to read-- \"scientific literature\". The purpose of popular science is to show scientific literature in a way that different types of scientists, and people who are not scientists, will easily understand. When people take an idea from scientific literature and change it into popular science, important things about that idea are often left out or added in.\n",
      "Scientific literature is made to seem like the ideas in it are not very new, and that the writer is not sure the idea is true. That way, other scientists will agree with the idea more. But popular science is made to be like other media, so many people will enjoy it. In popular science, ideas are made to sound like they are new, and like scientists all agree with the ideas. If scientific literature and popular science are compared, there is often a big difference. Even if most people agree about the subject, there is still a difference.\n",
      "Some popular science is made by people who do not understand the subject well. Some is made by people who have a strong bias. Some is part science and part pseudoscience. It can be hard for someone who is not an expert to tell which works of popular science are misleading.\n",

      "The Dresden University of Technology (\"TUD\") is the largest university in the state of Saxony and one of the 10 largest universities in Germany with 34,993 students.\n",
      "History.\n",
      "The University is one of the oldest colleges of technology in Germany.\n",
      "In 1828, the \"Saxon Technical School\" was founded to educate workers in technological subjects such as mechanics and ship construction. In 1871, the institute was renamed the Royal Saxon Polytechnic, and other subjects, such as history and languages, were introduced. By the end of the 19th century the institute had developed into a university covering all subjects. In 1961 it was then given its present name, the Dresden University of Technology ().\n",
      "Organization.\n",
      "The Dresden University of Technology is organised into 14 departments (\"faculties\"). Almost all faculties are located on the main campus South of the city centre, except for the Faculty of Medicine which has its own campus near the Elbe river, east of the city centre and the Department of Forestry in a town nearby called Tharandt.\n",
      "Reputation.\n",
      "The TU Dresden offers a broad range of courses and research. It has a high reputation in technical fields such as electrical engineering or computer science.\n",
      "The university also has a strong research tradition in microelectronics and transport sciences in the Dresden area, and now is becoming more important in new fields of research such as Biotechnology.\n",
      "Campus.\n",
      "TU Dresden is a \"campus university\", This means that most of its buildings are in one area rather than being spread out across the city. Some of its buildings are more than a hundred years old. In recent years these historic building have been complemented by modern buildings (e.g. the library, the main auditorium, the biochemistry department or the life sciences building).\n",
      "General.\n",
      "About 60% of the students come from Saxony, 19% from other Eastern German federal states, 12% from the Western German federal states and 10%from other countries.\n",
      "Only one quarter of the students from Saxony come from outside the Dresden and its suburbs.\n",
      "International Students.\n",
      "There are 3,442 international students enrolled at the TU Dresden (2005/2006). Most of the foreign students come from Europe (1,527), followed by Asia (1,404) and America (170). Ranked by countries the largest group of students comes from China (710), followed by Poland (294), Vietnam (196), Bulgaria (160) and Russia (154).\n",
      "The university is also quite popular among Central and East European countries such as the neighbouring Czech Republic (which is only away or Ukraine.\n",
      "Because of the Erasmus programme and partnerships with universities in the USA, there are many English, French and Spanish speaking students. But the language spoken during lessons is nearly always German. To prepare for the university, many international students attend German language courses at the University.\n",
      "International students interested in TU Dresden should visit the websites of the \" (International office) for more information. This office is responsible for handling international applications.\n",
      "Other activities.\n",
      "Sports are very popular among the TUD students. There are eight big students' clubs and the summer campus party is probably the biggest in Germany. There are cafeterias as at most universities and the largest refectory can compete with some restaurants even as far as menu size.\n",
